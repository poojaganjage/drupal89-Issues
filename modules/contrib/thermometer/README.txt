# THERMOMETER

The thermometer module provides a block to allow you to create a simple thermometer widget, useful for fundraising goals, without relying on an external third-party service, etc. It also uses CSS and Javascript, and not any Flash, etc.


## CONFIG OPTIONS

Enable the module. Go to the blocks page and configure the â€œProgress Thermometer" block. Place it where you want to see it! Configuration is available when you first place the block, and anytime thereafter by accessing it from the blocks page.

 * Progress so Far: Current amount raised towards your goal
 * Goal: Target amount of funds you want to raise
 * Button Text: Text for the donate button. Leave blank to not show a donate button.
 * Button URL: URL to page where people can donate.
 * Open in New Window: Enable to open the donate button url in a new window. Enabled by default.


## THEMING

The output is themeable, but beware that the JavaScript depends on the markup to a certain extent. Copy the thermometer.html.twig file in thermometer/templates to your themes folder to make modifications.
